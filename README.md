# photo-gallery
Displays all media from a folder.

### Usage
In `index.php`, change the `subdomain` variable to a string containing the name
of whatever subdomain you plan on deploying to on your server. If you aren't
putting it in a subdomain or are just running it locally, you can skip this step
and just leave it as an empty string.

Put all the images you plan on using in a folder named `content`.

### Plans
- Want to delete jQuery and possible Masonry from dependencies
- Add settings/options for different sizes and display styles
